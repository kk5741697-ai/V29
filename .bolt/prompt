multi-domain webtools website, need this all fixed.

don't just create unnecessary files like 
enhanced-*
simple-*
improved-*
advanced-*
etc.

any types of errors should not have in any bugs or problems in
@/lib/*
@/components/*
@/app/*
or any other things
never create unnecessary files, example: suppose i have already file image-processor.ts, now when i try to new chat or anything else, don't create like this or like anything duplicate real-image-processor.ts etc. hope you understand, you can just update the existing image-processor.ts initiate of real-image-processor.ts

image, pdf, and qr code tools will be same layout.

you need to make slug like this `/qr-code-generator` `/wifi-qr-code-generator` `email-qr-code-generator` etc. also
also in the qr code layout will be buttons for all type of qr code tools.

and also the pdf tools will be use pdf.js package. current pdf are getting attached page preview and downloaded output.
